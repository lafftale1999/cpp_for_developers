# Lesson 1: Course Introduction
Are you ready to dive into one of the most powerful programming languages out there? I hope so! Because this is going to be an exciting journey!

We’ll kick things off by walking through the course structure, objectives, and a few key recommendations to help you get the most out of our time together.

From there, we’ll explore the fascinating world of C++ – its history, why it remains such a cornerstone of software development, and what makes it such an exceptional language to learn. You’ll get a clear understanding of how a C++ program is organized, what compiling actually does, and how to run your very first program.

Finally, we’ll make sure you’re set up for success by installing all the tools you’ll need throughout the course.

# Lesson 2: 2. Data Types, Syntax and I/O
In this lesson, we’ll explore the fundamental building blocks of C++: its data types and syntax. You’ll gain a clear understanding of what variables are, what happens behind the scenes when you create them, and how to convert between different data types while working within their value ranges.

We’ll then move on to control statements and loops – core concepts that form the backbone of any programming language. Along the way, we’ll discuss naming conventions, best practices, and introduce some practical data structures to help you write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
