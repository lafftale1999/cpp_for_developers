# Lesson 3: Functions and File I/O
In this lesson, we’ll dive into one of the most powerful skills a programmer can develop: decomposition – the art of breaking complex systems into smaller, manageable, and reusable parts. We’ll achieve this by exploring functions: what they are, how to use them effectively, and the different types available in C++.

Furthermore, we’ll learn about file I/O operations. Until now, our programs have lived only in memory, forgetting everything once they stop running – but with file handling, that changes. You’ll learn how to read, write, and clear files, as well as explore common data formats for storing information.

# Lesson 4: OOP Introduction
In this lesson, we’ll take our first steps into object-oriented programming (OOP) – a paradigm that has shaped modern software development. You’ll learn about classes and objects, the core building blocks of OOP, and how constructors and destructors manage the lifecycle of those objects.

We’ll also dive into the principles of abstraction and encapsulation, exploring how they help you design cleaner, more maintainable, and more scalable programs.
