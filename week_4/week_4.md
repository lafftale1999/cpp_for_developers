# Lesson 7: Data Structures, Algorithms and Templates
In this lesson, we’ll dive into how C++ lets us build and work with dynamic data structures from the ground up. We’ll start by exploring how arrays can grow and adapt at runtime, and how smart pointers help us manage memory safely and efficiently.

We’ll then focus on writing generic code using templates, enabling us to implement data structures and algorithms that work seamlessly with different types — a core strength of modern C++.

From there, we’ll examine dynamic arrays, linked lists, and binary search trees, discussing how their internal organization affects data storage, access, and modification. Alongside this, we’ll cover fundamental searching and sorting algorithms, and analyze how they behave on different structures.

Finally, we’ll bring everything together by comparing the performance characteristics of these data structures, giving you a practical understanding of their trade-offs and real-world use cases.
