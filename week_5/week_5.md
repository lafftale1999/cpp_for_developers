# Lesson 9 and 10: Embedded Systems and Bit Manipulation
In this lesson, we’ll explore the basics of embedded systems. You’ll learn what defines an embedded system and the difference between microcontrollers (MCUs) and microprocessors (MPUs), along with a general overview of how their hardware is structured.

We’ll go over key terms like peripherals, modules, registers, firmware, and datasheets to help you understand the language of embedded development.

You’ll briefly learn about different types of operating systems used in embedded environments before setting up your tools by downloading the AVR library to program AVR microcontrollers. Using the Arduino Uno as our example, we’ll look at its basic architecture and how it fits into the bigger picture.

Finally, we’ll practice bit manipulation and write simple embedded programs for the AVR ATmega328p, giving you a first hands-on experience with low-level hardware control.
